              <h2><strong>Who are you? Why are you a good fit for this role?</strong></h2>

              <p>I'm a developer and writer with 4 years of experience in the tech industry. I’ve worked with developers, project managers, customer support specialists, QA analysts, and clients… all with differing domains of expertise and awareness levels on every topic and issue you can imagine.</p>

              <p><strong>I find fulfillment in solving people's pains and problems. I feel great when I've made someone's day by helping them find solution they've been looking for. It makes me feel like I've done something to make the world a better place, no matter how small it might have been.</strong></p>

              <p>I've written countless documents, articles, and instructions for all kinds of audiences, both technical and non-technical. I’ve had to explain the behavior of bugs to developers and temporary workarounds for testers and customers. I’ve had to come up with simple explanations about complex issues for non-technical managers, testers, and customers.</p>

              <p>I see this as a form of problem-solving in the domain of human interaction. It all comes down to understanding the differing awareness levels around any given issue, then crafting the right set of words to bring everything together in a way that brings the greatest benefit to everyone.</p>

              <h2><strong>Explain a scenario where you had to tell a customer “no” or had to correct their mistake.</strong></h2>
              <p>A client of mine requested an extraordinarily complex design for her business website, citing a design firm’s portfolio site as an example of what she wanted. Coming from a non-technical background, she did not understand the complexity and scope of implementing such a design.</p>

              <p>So, I explained to her in non-technical terms that not only would this be way over her current budget, it was unnecessary and even hurtful to the purpose of her site. The visually stunning design would have caused potential compatibility issues across varying browsers and devices and would have overshadowed the content that truly matters.</p>

              <p>She obliged and we reached an agreement to build a responsive website that would be much easier for her target audience to load and navigate. It was a great success and brought her more customers than either of us had imagined.</p>

              <h2><strong>Do you believe the customer is always right?</strong></h2>

              <p>No. Customers are not always right, but their satisfaction is paramount to the success of a business. A happy customer is one that will return again and again. The more value is given to a customer, the more value the customer will give back.</p>

              <p>Conflicts should be handled in a way that maintains good relationships between a company and its customers. In fact, conflict is often the opportunity for an even better relationship - it becomes a catalyst for growth when handled in the right way.</p>

              <blockquote>"'Focus on winning one customer at a time. Be honest and sincere. Do what’s right. There’s nothing magical about this.' That’s been my guiding principle. To make it work, you have to live it every day. Make it your mind-set."</blockquote>
