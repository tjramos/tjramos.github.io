										<h2>Landing Pages | Sales Pages | Websites | E-Mails | PPC Ads</h2>

									<p>
										I specialize in creating and optimizing high-converting landing pages, sales pages, websites, e-mails, and PPC ads.
									</p>
									<p>
											As a business owner, it can be incredibly hard to get people to understand
											<ul>
													<li>who you are</li>
													<li>what you are all about</li>
													<li>what makes you unique and different from the competition</li>
													<li>why your solution is worth the investment, and how their lives will be better off because of it</li>
											</ul>
									</p>
									<p>
											It's also hard to get people to notice you - to stand out in a noisy world where everyone's trying to sell you something, and where few truly care about helping you.
									</p>
									<p>
											This is the greatest problem in today's markets - they are oversaturated with all kinds of offers, all offering almost exactly the same thing.
									</p>
									<p>
											How do you convince people that you're different? How do you tell them what they're missing, or even get them to listen to what you're saying?
									</p>
									<p>
											I've been there. I know what it's like. I've put in hundreds of hours to create products that got to no one, because I didn't know how to make them stand out.
									</p>
									<p>
											I had to painfully learn that great copy that communicates your value and resonates with your audience is of the most difficult, yet most essential components of success in any business.
									</p>
									<p>
										Don't make the same mistakes I did. If you've got something valuable, make sure people <em>truly understand your value.</em>
									</p>
									<p>
											I'm here to take your vision and put it into words that motivate, inspire, and compel readers to take action. To take your product or service and position it in a way that attracts attention, channels desire, and gets readers to say YES!.
										</p>
									<p>All of my Conversion Copy:
										<ul>
											<li>Uses powerful, consistent voice and positioning that represents you and your brand both accurately and in a compelling way</li>
											<li>Communicates your value and resonates with your audience</li>
											<li>Captivates and engages readers so effectively they donâ€™t even realize why they can't say no to your offer</li>
											<li>Makes more money - because not only does money give you the opportunity to create even greater impact, it is the most direct and accurate measure of the value received</li>
										</ul>
